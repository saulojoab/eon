##### _NOTE: Eon depends entirely on the [Consumet API](https://github.com/consumet/consumet.ts) in order to work._
 
EON is a cross-platform React Native manga reading application, which will have an application for Android, iOS, and Desktop (Mac, Windows, and Linux).

With EON, users are able to access a wide variety of Japanese mangas, with the possibility of reading on different devices and operating systems. In addition, being open-source, users can contribute to the development of the application and help make it even better.
