# üìñ EON

EON is a cross-platform React Native manga reading application, which will have an application for Android, iOS, and Desktop (Mac, Windows, and Linux). The great differential of EON is that it uses open-source manga sources.

With EON, users will be able to access a wide variety of Japanese mangas, with the possibility of reading on different devices and operating systems. In addition, being open-source, users can contribute to the development of the application and help make it even better.

The EON application promises to be an excellent option for Japanese manga lovers who want to have access to a vast library of works without restrictions on devices or operating systems.
